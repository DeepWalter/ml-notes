\section{Multilayer Feedforward Networks are Universal Approximators}
This paper\cite{hornik_1989} proves that standard multilayer feedforward networks with as few as one hidden 
layer using arbitrary squashing functions are capable of approximating any Borel measureble function, provided
sufficiently many hidden units are available.

\begin{df}[Squashing function]
    A function $\phi: \mathbb{R}\longrightarrow [0, 1]$ is a squashing function if and only if it is non-decreasing, 
    satifies $\lim_{\lambda \to \infty}\phi(\lambda) = 1$ and $\lim_{\lambda \to -\infty}\phi(\lambda) = 0$.
\end{df}
